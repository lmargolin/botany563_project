- Picked Data Set
- I plan on working with 11 species of pikas (ochotona). This dataset contains sequences from 12 loci that were aligned with ClustalW. Here is the link to the dataset on DRYAD: https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.bn547#usage 
- Quality Control: QC was already preformed when data was accesses. Raw reads were not provided. No further action needed to be completed.
